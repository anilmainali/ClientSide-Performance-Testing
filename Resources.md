### Time to First Byte (TTFB)

Time to First Byte (TTFB) is the total amount of time spent to receive the first byte of the response once it has been requested. It is the sum of "Redirect duration" + "Connection duration" + "Backend duration". This metric is one of the key indicators of web performance.

In the Waterfall Chart, it is calculated at the start of the test until just before receiving on the page request and represented by the orange line.

Some ways to improve the TTFB include: optimizing application code, implementing caching, fine-tuning your web server configuration, or upgrading server hardware.
